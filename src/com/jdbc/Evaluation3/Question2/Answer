The execute() ==>method is the most general method you can use to run an SQL statement in JDBC. To execute an SQL statement using the execute method,
call it by passing a valid SQL statement to it as a String object or as a string literal.

executeUpdate(String SQL)==>: Returns the number of rows affected by the execution of the SQL statement. Use this method to execute SQL statements where you expect a certain number of rows to be affectedâ€”for example,
INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements.

executeQuery(String SQL)==> Returns a ResultSet object. Use this method if you expect to get a result set,
just like with a SELECT statement.
