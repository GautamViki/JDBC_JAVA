 Statement : ==> It is used to access your database. The command interface cannot accept parameters and
 is useful when you use static SQL commands at runtime. If you only want to run the SQL query once,
 then this interface is preferred over PreparedStatement.

 Prepared Statement:==>
 It is used when you want to use SQL statements many times.
 The PreparedStatement interface accepts input parameters at runtime.
